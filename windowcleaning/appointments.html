                <p>We currently serve Farmington, UT. If you're nearby and unsure if we can reach you, just ask! Our simple pricing is $3 per window pane. We look forward to meeting you—and making your windows sparkle! We started this business because we wanted to go beyond the average part-time job. We wanted to take responsibility, offer real value, and show that teens can run a top-notch service with pride. What began as a few weekend cleanings has grown into a reliable business trusted by neighbors and local businesses alike. We treat every job with care and attention—because your satisfaction is how we grow. We've invested in pro-grade tools, learned proven window-washing techniques, and even got insured—so you can feel confident when we show up at your door. A Few Things About Us: We're students and close friends. We believe hard work matters more than age. We're reliable, respectful, and results-focused. Every job helps us save for future goals (and maybe college!). We're proud to serve our local community with honesty, energy, and good old-fashioned elbow grease. Thanks for giving us the opportunity to earn your trust—and make your windows shine. Clean Windows. Clear Views. Bright Futures.</p>
